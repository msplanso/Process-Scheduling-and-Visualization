			<ul style = "list-style-type:circle">
		    <li> The objective of this GUI is to graphically visualize of the different scheduling process.</li>
		    <li> The user can create a scheduling process by dragging and dropping individual Steps from Scheduling Models to the GANT chart.</li>
		    <li> After creating a scheduling process, the user can see the visualization by clicking the start button.</li>
		    <li> The operation can be paused in the middle by clicking the Stop button and changes can be made to the schedule</li>
	      <li> If changes are made in the middle the process has to start from the beginning again</li>
				<li> Only two processes can start at the same time.</li>
				<li> Starting more than two processes at the same time is infeasible.</li>
	      <li> The GANT chart picturizes the execution of the process and also the elapsed time</li>			
				<li> The recipes and steps can be chosen in random order.</li>      
	      <li> The user can select different Scheduling Model from the Type button.</li> 
			</ul> 
	 
	    <h4 class = "heading">GANT CHART TERMINOLOGIES</h4>
	    <ul style = "list-style-type:circle">  
	      <li>If a recipe is dragged and dropped in the chart it will be picturized as a block in the respective stages.</li>
	      <li>To move the block left mouse click can be used.</li>
	      <li>To delete a block right mouse click can be used.</li>
	      <li>The schedule can be changed both before and during the plant operation</li>
