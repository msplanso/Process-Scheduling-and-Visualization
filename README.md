* The operation can be paused in the middle by clicking the Stop button and changes can be made to the schedule(mouse right click will remove a step from GANT chart).
* If changes are made in the middle the process has to start from the beginning again.
* The GANT chart picturizes the execution of the process and also the elapsed time.
